# WRAVEN Field Ops Docs

This repo contains open-source cheat sheets, references, and tools maintained by the WRAVEN threat research team.

Every file here is synced directly to members‚Äô Kali instances for fast, offline access during ops, CTFs, and research. If it‚Äôs in here, it‚Äôs because someone actually used it.
